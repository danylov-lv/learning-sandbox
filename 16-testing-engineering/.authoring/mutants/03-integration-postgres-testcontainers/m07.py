"""BUG: `page` fetches one row more than `limit`.

Both branches of `page` pass `limit + 1` to `LIMIT` instead of `limit`.
Every page silently contains one extra row beyond what the caller asked
for. A caller that assumes a page has at most `limit` rows (a very
reasonable assumption from the function's own signature) gets a
larger-than-requested page, and totals computed by summing page sizes
across a full pagination walk come out wrong.
